# Come and Worship

## Lyrics

He is the King, the Messiah that was promised,  
Emmanuel, "God with us", the Holy One!  
Jesus is here!  The desire of every nation  
Is bringing the end of expectation.  The King has come!  
So come and worship!  

## Notes

This flexible little chorus written in December 2013 has been appended
to a few different Christmas carols (such as "Hark the Herald Angels
Sing", "Angels We Have Heard on High", and "Angels From the Realms of
Glory").
