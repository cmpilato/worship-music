# Gracious and Holy

## Lyrics

You made the Earth and the heavens.  
Spoke words to form them and fill them.  
So all that we have is by Your hand.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
You gave us freedom and purpose.  
We chose rebellion and curses.  
But hope lingered under the surface.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
  
You are here, always with me,  
Nearer than sacred to naked should be.  
You speak promises over my shame.  
I know that I'll never be the same.  
  
You came to dwell with Your people;  
Strengthen the downcast and feeble;  
And rescue us from every evil.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
Humbly you gave Your life for us.  
Hope is reversing our curses,  
Restoring our freedom and purpose.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
  
You are here, always with me.  
Nearer than righteous to wretched should be.  
You speak promises over my shame.  
I know that I'll never be the same.  
  
Now you are seated in Heaven,  
So, by the Spirit You've given,  
We will proclaim, "Christ is risen!"  
Gracious and holy You are.  
Gracious and holy You are.  
  
You are here, always with me,  
Nearer forever than failure could be.  
You poured righteousness over my shame.  
Called me Your child and then gave me Your name.  
You are here, always with me,  
Nearer forever than failure could be.  
You poured righteousness over my shame.  
I know that I'll never be the same.  
I know that I'll never be the same.  

## Notes

On July 4, 2021, I was hiking the Robbins Branch Loop Trail in the
Uwharrie National Forest.  I kept trying to calm my mind, but it
seemed frantic &mdash; jumping from thought to thought across all the
various roles I play (husband, parent, employee, worship leader,
etc.).  At one point I yelled aloud in frustration, "Why is so noisy
in here?!"  My mind wandered to a collection of conversations and
podcasts about the biblical theological theme of God's presence, all
supplemented by the fact that a dear friend Rev. Evan Smith had begun
a sermon series in our church on the same.  His plan to was visit this
theme in four alliterated parts: Eden, Exodus, Embodiment, and
Eternity.  In what seemed like no time at all, the melody and opening
words of the chorus of this song were in my head.  I spent the next
several hours (and about 8 miles of hiking) developing the skeleton of
the song (tripping occasionally when I pulled my phone out to make a
voice recording or a lyric note).  I spent the next week putting meat
on the song skeleton.
