# Christ Is Our Cornerstone

## Lyrics

Christ is our cornerstone.  
On Him alone we build.  
With His true saints alone,  
The courts of heav'n are filled.  
On His great love, our hopes we place.  
Of joys above and present grace.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  

With psalms and hymns of praise,  
This holy place shall ring.  
Our voices we will raise,  
The three-in-one to sing.  
And thus proclaim in joyful song,  
That glorious name both loud and long.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  

Here gracious God draw near,  
As in your name we bow.  
Each true petition hear.  
Accept each faithful vow.  
And more and more on all who pray  
Your blessings pour each holy day.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  

Here may we gain from heav'n,  
The grace which we implore.  
And may that grace once giv'n  
Be with us evermore.  
Until that day when all the blessed  
Are called away to endless rest.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  
We build on Him alone.  

## Notes

This song is an original tune applied June 17, 2022, to the words of
the Public Domain hymn, "Christ Is Our Cornerstone" (by John
Chandler).  The lyrical shape has been preserved, with a few small
exceptions, namely the reversal of the final two lines of each
original stanza to preserve the desired rhyme schema and revisitation
of the central theme at the end of each verse.
