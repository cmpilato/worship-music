# Christ Is Our Cornerstone

## Lyrics

Christ is our cornerstone.  
On Him alone we build.  
With His true saints alone,  
The courts of heav'n are filled.  
On His great love, our hopes we place.  
Of joys above and present grace.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  

With psalms and hymns of praise,  
This holy place shall ring.  
Our voices we will raise,  
The three-in-one to sing.  
And thus proclaim in joyful song,  
That glorious name both loud and long.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  

Jesus is our firm foundation,  
Strength that flows from God's right hand.  
He's the Rock of our Salvation,  
And the gates of Hell won't stand.  

Here may we gain from heav'n,  
The grace which we implore.  
And may that grace once giv'n  
Be with us evermore.  
Until that day when all the blessed  
Are called away to endless rest.  
Christ is our cornerstone.  
We build on Him alone.  
We build on Him alone.  

## Notes

This song is an original tune applied to a lyrical base consisting of
stanzas from the Public Domain hymn, "Christ Is Our Cornerstone"
(translated by John Chandler) plus an original bridge section.
Chandler's original lyrical shape and content have been mostly
preserved, save for the reversal of each stanza's final two lines (to
preserve a modern rhyme scheme), and a refrain revisiting the central
theme to close out each verse.

Application of the original tune took place on June 17, 2022.  On June
27, 2022, the piece was reworked to include the bridge.
