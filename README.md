# Worship Music

Original music, composed by [C. Michael
Pilato](http://cmichaelpilato.com) and others for the Christian church
and permissively licensed.

## Why?

Whether a worship song that I write is originally just a personal act
of worship to God or intended for collective use for that purpose by
my local church family, it is an offering to God not altogether
different from a financial offering — He is the Provider of all my
creative ability, so I return to Him a portion of that time and
talent.  I want this music to serve God and His Church, and that
opportunity would be diminished by restrictively licensing the works.
I've been self-publishing on the Internet the lyrics and demo
recordings of my worship songs since I first started writing them, but
I realized that not having a canonical representation of at least the
melodic lead vocal line could still be a barrier to adoption for
others wishing to learn and use this music.  This repository and its
content are the direct result of that realization and my attempt to
mitigate that problem.

## Yeah, but why?

As a beneficiary of and contributor to free and open-source software
for decades, I recognize the value of things developed and released
openly, where other people's critical eyes can improve quality and
where there are fewer barriers to adoption (cost, usage prohibitions,
etc.).  It makes sense to me that this model as applied to other
creative disciplines (music, film, art, etc.) is not only viable, but
desirable.  Culture demands to be free, and the artistic expressions
found in the arts are some of the most culture-preserving and
culture-defining things extant.

When discussing worship music specifically, this is art "created" (at
least ostensibly) for God and His Church.  And given both the
universal applicability of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the
evangelistic mission of the Church, I simply cannot fathom why any
Christian musician would allow _anything_ to prevent the widest
distribution of that Truth in song possible.

Moreover, as worship music often (and necessarily, I'd say) uses the
Holy Bible as a source text for lyrical inspirition — plus the general
fact that [everything is a remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc)
— the notion of a worship song being the result of truly creative _ex
nihilo_ act by a single or small handful of actors (songwriters)
simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny.  _Every_ songwriter stands on the
shoulders of those who've gone before them — creators of instruments,
of musical theory, of language and its nuances, of symbolism and
metaphor found in the physical world, etc.  And if you trace backward
the lineage of every stage of the remixing, reprocessing, repurposing
act that we call "creativity" to its original source, you find that
all things spring from a single place: God, _the_ Creator.
