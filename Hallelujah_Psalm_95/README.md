# Hallelujah (Psalm 95)

## Lyrics

Come, let us sing for joy. 
Come, let us kneel before 
The Lord our God, 
The Lord our Maker. 
 
Come, bring Him gratitude. 
Come, let Him make us new. 
The Lord our God, 
The Lord our Maker. 
 
Kings fall down, He stands above. 
Our great God, and His great love. 
All creation will lift Him up,  
With "Hallelujah!" 
 
Come, let us all bow down. 
Come, let us shout out loud 
To the Rock 
Of our Salvation! 
 
Kings fall down, He stands above. 
Our great God, and His great love. 
All creation will lift Him up,  
With "Hallelujah!" 
 
Kings fall down, He stands above. 
Our great God, and His great love. 
All creation will lift Him up … 
 
Hallelujah, we will sing.  Hallelujah, to our King. 
Hallelujah for everything that You are, and that You've done. 
Hallelujah! 
 
Kings fall down, You rise above. 
Our great God, and Your great love. 
All creation will lift You up … 
 
Hallelujah, we will sing.  Hallelujah, to our King. 
Hallelujah for everything that You are, and that You've done. 
Hallelujah, we adore.  Hallelujah, to our Lord. 
Hallelujah forevermore and ever more … 
Hallelujah! 
Hallelujah! 

## Notes

Written Monday, April 13, 2015, after Pastor John Cashwell's Sunday
sermon on worship in tough times (at Providence Baptist Church,
Harrisburg, NC). Psalm 95 was the key text of the message, and in the
services he encouraged the church to literally shout "Hallelujah".
