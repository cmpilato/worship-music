# To God Be the Glory (Praise the Lord)

## Lyrics

To God be the glory; great things He hath done.  
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,  
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin  
And opened the lifegate that all may go in.  
  
Praise the Lord!  Let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord!  Let the people rejoice!  
Praise the Lord!  Let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord!  
  
O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood.  
To every believer, the promise of God:  
The vilest offender who truly believes,  
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.  
  
Praise the Lord!  Let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord!  Let the people rejoice!  
Praise the Lord!  Let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord!  
  
O come to the Father  
Through Jesus Christ the Son!  
O come to the Father  
Through Jesus Christ the Son!  
  
Great things He hath taught us; great things He hath done.  
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son.  
But purer and higher and greater will be  
Our wonder — our vict'ry — when Jesus we see!  
  
Praise the Lord!  Let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord!  Let the people rejoice!  
Praise the Lord!  Let the earth hear His voice!  
Praise the Lord!  
Praise the Lord!  
Praise the Lord!  

## Notes

_To God Be the Glory_ is a hymn whose lyrics were written by Fanny
Crosby.  It was first published (paired with a tune by William Howard
Doane) in 1875.  This variant is merely a new arrangement that I
created in 2009.  It (mostly) honors the original melody, while
translating from a 3/4 to a 4/4 time signature.
