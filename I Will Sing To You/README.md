# I Will Sing To You

## Lyrics

My heart is sure, O God.  
I am secure, O God.  
With everything my soul will sing to  
You.  I will awaken the dawn.  
    
Great are you, Lord; higher than heavens.  
Your faithfulness fills the skies.  
Be exalted, O Lord, above all the heavens  
And let Your glory rise!  
    
I will sing to You.  
I will sing to You.  
I will praise You, O God, before the world!
