# I Will Sing To You

## Lyrics

    My heart is sure, O God
    I am secure, O God
    With everything my soul will sing to
    You, I will awaken the dawn
    
    Great are you, Lord, higher than heavens
    Your faithfulness fills the skies
    Be exalted, O Lord, above all the heavens
    And let Your glory rise!
    
    I will sing to You
    I will sing to You
    I will praise You, O God, before the world!
