# Precious Lord

## Lyrics

Son comes up. Blood flows down.  
Word made flesh; Truth made jest; curse made crown.  
Sun goes dark. Love's work done.  
Landscapes shake; strongholds quake; Love has won.  

Precious Lord, please forgive.  
Draw me close; help me live for you.  
Precious Lord.  

Here I stand, no defense.  
Stained by sin, scrubbing crimson fingerprints.  
Son comes up. Day breaks new.  
Life beats Death; Christ breathes breath; Love breaks through.  

Precious Lord, please forgive.  
Draw me close; help me live for you.  
And one day, let my reward  
Be the sight of my Precious Lord.
