# Yours Forever, Amen

## Lyrics

Oh, Abba Father, High King of Heaven,  
Holy, holy, is Your Name.  
Your kingdom come and Your will be done in  
Heaven above and earth the same.  

Oh, Abba Father, High King of Heaven,  
Give us daily all we need.  
And please forgive us, as we forgive those,  
Who, like us, caused Your Son to bleed.  

Yours forever is the kingdom!  Yours forever is the power!  
Yours forever is the glory, amen!  
Yours forever is the kingdom!  Yours forever is the power!  
Yours forever is the glory, amen!  Amen.  

Oh, Abba Father, High King of Heaven,  
Rescue us from the evil one,  
And lead us far from every temptation â€”  
This bride keep spotless for Your Son.  

Yours forever is the kingdom!  Yours forever is the power!  
Yours forever is the glory, amen!  
Yours forever is the kingdom!  Yours forever is the power!  
Yours forever is the glory, amen!  Amen.  

To You, who's able to do (so much)  
More than we ask or (could) even imagine,  
Be endless glory, love and fame.  
Bring endless glory (to Your name)!  

Yours forever is the kingdom!  Yours forever is the power!  
Yours forever is the glory, amen!  
Yours forever is the kingdom!  Yours forever is the power!  
Yours forever is the glory, amen!  Amen.  
Yours forever, amen.  
Yours forever, amen.  

## Notes

This original version of this song (based on the Lord's Prayer) was writting March 8, 2016.
The ending bit (taken from Ephesians 3:20-21) was added much later on June 22, 2018.
