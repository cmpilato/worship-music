## Lyrics

Oh, what a time.  Humanity broken.  
Long had the world in darkness lain.  
Gone were the days of prophecy spoken.  
Gone was the age of David's reign.  

Oh, what a sign!  The virgin girl Mary,  
Caused to conceive by God alone.  
Long-promised hope: the baby she'd carry  
One day would claim King David's throne.  

Worship the King.  Come let us now adore Him.  
Jesus is here and we can be free.  
Bring ev'rything.  Lay it all down before Him.  
Sorrow turns joy for all who receive Jesus the King.  

Oh, what a night in the city of David.  
There where the holy child was born.  
One Son of God.  One true Messiah.  
One King to reign forevermore!  

Worship the King.  Come let us now adore Him.  
Jesus is here and we can be free.  
Bring ev'rything.  Lay it all down before Him.  
Sorrow turns joy for all who receive Jesus the King.  

Wonderful Counselor, Everlasting Father,  
Prince of Peace, Mighty God, Holy One, Redeemer,  
Emmanuel, God With Us, Living Word, Christ Jesus,  
King of Kings and Lord of Lords!  

Worship the King.  Come let us now adore Him.  
Jesus is here and we can be free.  
Bring ev'rything.  Lay it all down before Him.  
Sorrow turns joy for all who receive Jesus the King.  
Jesus is King!
