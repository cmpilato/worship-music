# It's You

## Lyrics

It's You who set the world in motion.  
It's You who governs over all.  
It's You who brings the sunshine after the rain  
And You who makes the rain to fall.  
  
It's You who holds us when we're hurting.  
It's You who lifts us when we're down.  
It's you who offers peace when we can't understand  
And you who stands beside us now.  
  
Give us this day our daily bread and grace to face what lies ahead;  
A humble spirit so we'll give the credit where it's due, yeah.  
We're asking not to win the war but strength to fight just one day more  
So when the victory comes it's You.  Lord, it's You.  
  
It's You who knows our every weakness.  
It's You who fashioned every one.  
It's You who calls the faithful to trust You again  
For You, yes You, have overcome!  
  
Give us this day our daily bread and grace to face what lies ahead;  
A humble spirit so we'll give the credit where it's due, yeah.  
We're asking not to win the war but strength to fight just one day more  
So when the victory comes it's You.  Lord, it's You!  
  
Lord, You're near to us, but it's mysterious  
How You nourish us with manna from above.  
It's not logical; it's a miracle  
Lord, You're wonderful and worthy of our love!  
  
Give us this day our daily bread and grace to face what lies ahead;  
A humble spirit so we'll give the credit where it's due, yeah.  
We're asking not to win the war but strength to fight just one day more  
So when the victory comes it's You.  Lord, it's You!
