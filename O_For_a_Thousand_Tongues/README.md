# O For a Thousand Tongues

## Lyrics

All-gracious Master, glorious God,  
Give me the words to proclaim.  
Spread thru the whole earth, here and abroad,  
The honor of Your holy name.  
Father, You give me the choice,  
But Your grace compels me to lift up my voice.  
If I was mute, I'd still make joyful noise to Thee.  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing!  
  
Jesus, your name calms the deepest of fears.  
You bid every sorrow to cease.  
Your mercy is music in this sinner's ears&mdash;  
Your love is the source of my peace.  
Savior, You knew all along  
That you'd trade perfection for all I'd do wrong.  
Lord, may my life make a beautiful song to Thee.  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing!  
  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise!  
Sing of the glories of my King; the triumph of His grace!  
  
Jesus you've broken the power of sin.  
Your blood sets the prisoners free.  
Dying you saved us, then rising again  
Accomplished supreme victory!  
  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing our great Redeemer's praise!  
Sing of the glories of our King; the triumph of His grace!  
Your church in heav'n and earth below, this sacrifice we bring!  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing.  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing.  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing.  
  
Spirit of God, fill this place.  
Write on our hearts songs of mercy and grace.  
Oh, God, we're desperate to give every praise to Thee.  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing!  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing!  
O, for a thousand tongues to sing!

## Notes

This song began in January 2016 as a modernized arrangement of the
hymn, "O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing" which preserved the original
melody and most of the original lyrics, but added what is here the
second halves of the verses.  Unfortunately, that combination never
really worked, musically.  I always liked those additions, though, and
was saddened by the mismatch and failed integration of them into the
original hymn.

On June 30, 2020, however, I gave up trying to make fit what never
would, and instead restructured the whole song around my additions,
heavily editing the original hymn lyric and melody while trying to
preserve the essence of what it said.  The beautiful sentiment held by
the original song&mdash;to wish that one had a thousand tongues to sing
God's praise all the louder!&mdash;remains the core of this song.
