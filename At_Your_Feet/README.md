# At Your Feet

## Lyrics

Let the rocks cry out.  Let the people shout,  
For the King has come to claim His throne.  
For the Son who lives is the one who gives  
His life to save my wretched soul.  
Hallelujah, Lord of all!  

At your feet we bow.  
On our knees we fall down.  

Let Your praises ring, ever echoing,  
For Your blood has bought me liberty.  
Let Your church proclaim Your eternal name  
For the Son of God has overcome the grave.  

At your feet we bow.  
On our knees we fall down.  
At your feet we bow.  
On our knees we fall down.  

You are the love that gives everything.  
You are the author of history.  
You are the refuge that I need.  
You are the righteous and worthy.  
You are the steadfast before me.  
All hail the name above all names!
