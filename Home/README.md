## Lyrics

On this road I walk along,  
Seasons dim and seasons dawn  
And the years keep rambling on.  
They ramble on.  
I know well this world I see,  
Shared with friends and family,  
But a voice keeps telling me  
I'm sick for home.  

Jesus, only You can satisfy.  
You alone make all things new.  
You're the Way, the Truth, the Life and I'm,  
Oh I'm, coming home to You.  

The rugged cross that Jesus bore  
Draws my thoughts towards Heaven's shore  
Where the One I'm living for  
Prepares my home.  
Lord, the beauty of your grace  
And the promise of your face  
Bid me make this world a better place  
Until I'm home.  

Jesus, only You can satisfy.  
You alone make all things new.  
You're the Way, the Truth, the Life and I'm,  
Oh I'm, coming home to You.  

I'm coming home!  

Jesus, only You can satisfy.  
You alone make all things new.  
You're the Way, the Truth, the Life and I'm,  
Oh I'm, coming home to You.  
Lord, I'm coming home to You.  

When my final day is done  
And this earthly race is run,  
I will bow before the One  
Who calls me home.  
Yes I'll bow before the One  
Who calls me home.
