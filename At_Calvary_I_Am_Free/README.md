# At Calvary (I Am Free)

## Lyrics

Years I spent in vanity and pride,  
Caring not my Lord was crucified,  
Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.  
  
By God's Word at last my sin I learned,  
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,  
Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.  
  
Mercy there was great and grace was free.  
Pardon there was multiplied to me.  
There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary!  
  
Oh the love that drew salvation's plan!  
Oh the grace that brought it down to man!  
Oh the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!  
  
Mercy there was great and grace was free.  
Pardon there was multiplied to me.  
There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary!  
  
I am free.  I am free.  
By the mercy of God's great grace, I am free.  
I am free (and I am forgiven).  I am free (and now I am living).  
By the mercy of God's great grace, I am free.  
  
Now I give to Jesus everything.  
Now I gladly own Him as my King.  
Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!  

## Notes

This song is a modernization of the hymn _At Calvary_, with minor
changes to the arrangement, cadence, and chord structure, but
preserving the original melody.  A simple and original bridge has been
introduced to add variation.

Also, the original hymn's third verse began, "Now I've given to Jesus
everything." Not only did this fit only somewhat forcedly into the
song's cadence, but — at least for me — the process of such surrender
is ongoing and incomplete.  So here, the lyric is modified to "Now I
give to Jesus everything", which has the added benefit of additional
parallelism with the subsequent lyric.
