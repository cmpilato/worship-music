# Praise You All the Time

## Lyrics

You're the God of the Universe.
You're the Treasure of utmost worth.
You're the Water for all my thirst, and I will praise You.
You're the Lord of the highest mountain.
You're the Knowledge of all that's hidden.
You're the Source of eternal wisdom, and I will praise You.

I'll praise You in the morning sun,
And praise You when the day is done,
When night falls, You're always on my mind.
And even as I close my eyes
And bid another day goodbye
You'll find that I am still inclined
To praise You all the time.

You're the Artist of everything.
You're the King over every king.
You're the Song all creation sings, and I will praise You.
You're the Light in the darkest places.
You're the Ruler of every nation.
You're the Author of my salvation, and I will praise You

I'll praise You in the morning sun,
And praise You when the day is done,
When night falls, You're always on my mind.
And even as I close my eyes
And bid another day goodbye
You'll find that I am still inclined
To praise You all the time.

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,
The King of creation.
O, my soul, praise Him
For He is thy health and salvation!

You're the Voice when all else goes silent.
You're the Calm when the seas get violent.

I'll praise You in the morning sun,
And praise You when the day is done,
When night falls, You're always on my mind.
And even as I close my eyes
And bid another day goodbye
You'll find that I am still inclined
To praise You in the morning sun,
And praise You when the day is done,
When night falls, You're always on my mind.
I'll praise You all the time.
