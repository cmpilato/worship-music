# Father, Hear the Prayer We Offer (Where You Lead)

## Lyrics

Father, hear the prayer we offer.  
Not for ease our prayer shall be,  
But for strength that we may ever  
Live our lives courageously.  
  
Not for ever in green pastures  
Do we ask our way to be,  
But the steep and rugged pathway  
May we tread rejoicingly.  
  
Let not these words ring hollow,  
This we plead.  
Lord, make us brave to follow  
Where you lead.  
  
Not for ever by still waters  
Would we idly rest and stay,  
But would strike the living fountains  
From the rocks along our way.  
  
Be our strength in hours of weakness.  
In our wanderings, be our guide.  
Through endeavour and failure and danger,  
Father, be there at our side.  
  
Let not these words ring hollow,  
This we plead.  
Lord, make us brave to follow  
Where you lead.  
Let not these words ring hollow,  
This we plead.  
Lord, make us brave to follow  
Where you lead.  
  
Let our path be bright or dreary,  
Storm or sunshine be our share;  
May our souls in hope unweary  
Make Thy work our ceaseless prayer.  

## Notes

On January 9, 2018, I set for myself the challenge of taking a song
I'd never heard, and whose lyrics were old and not
copyright-encumbered, and creating an original melody for the song.  I
selected the hymn "Father, Hear the Prayer We Offer", whose lyrics
were written by Love Maria Willis.  I'd never seen music for, nor
heard a recording of, this hymn, but set about writing one of my own.
A short time later, I found that some hymnals carry a fifth verse
whose author is unknown, but is suspected to be Samuel Longfellow.
This I added to my variant, too.  The chorus lyrics were my own
original additions, too.
