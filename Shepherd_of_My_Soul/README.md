# Shepherd of My Soul

## Lyrics

You are my Shepherd.  
I'll want for nothing.  
You make me lie down  
In pastures of green.  
Beside still waters  
And down paths of righteousness  
All for your name's sake,  
Shepherd, you lead.  
    
You restore my soul.  You restore my soul.  
Surely goodness and mercy will follow.  
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever,  
There with my Shepherd, Shepherd of my soul.  
    
Even when walking  
Down through the valley  
There in death's shadow  
No evil I'll fear.  
You're always with me.  
Your rod and staff comfort me.  
Jesus, my Shepherd,  
You're always near.  
    
You set a table before me,  
With my enemies all around.  
Let your anointing fall on me.  
Let my cup overflow with your pow'r.
