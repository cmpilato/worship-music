# Risen and Conquering King

## Lyrics

Glory to Your Name! 
Glory to Your Name! 
Glory to Your Name! 

Risen and conquering King. 
Humbly we praise. 
Master of everything. 
Now and always. 

You traded splendor You deserve, 
And bought us at great price. 
You paid a debt that was not Yours 
And brought us back to life. 
Glory to Your Name! 

Risen and conquering King. 
Humbly we praise. 
Master of everything. 
Now and always. 

Fulfulling what the prophets said, 
You gave all You could give, 
Then, rising, crushed the serpent's head 
That stillborn souls might live! 
Glory to Your Name! 
Glory to Your Name! 
Glory to Your Name! 

Jesus, Saviour, 
Mighty Conqueror — 
Now and forever You will reign. 

## Notes

The admittedly charged word "stillborn" has at times been replaced with "shattered".
