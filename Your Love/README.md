# Your Love

## Lyrics

The world around me crumbles  
And I don't always know where to begin.  
It seems as if the rules have all been changed.  
But even when I stumble,  
You are there to dust me off again.  
Your love remains the same.  

Now I can't see You, and I can't hear You,  
But I know You're listening to me.  
So I can't feel You, but I don't need to.  
God, Your love is a mystery to me.  

I'm trying to hear Your whisper,  
Buried in the chaos and the noise,  
And struggling to tune my heart to Yours.  
And all I know is this truth:  
Even if I cannot hear your voice,  
You're boundless love endures!  

Now I can't see You, and I can't hear You,  
But I know You're listening to me.  
So I can't feel You, but I don't need to.  
God, Your love is a mystery to me.  

(I am) Standing on Your Word, standing on Your Word,  
And on Your promises.  
Standing on Your Word, standing on Your Word.  
What kind of love is this?  
Standing on Your Word, standing on Your Word,  
And on Your promises  
Whoa!
