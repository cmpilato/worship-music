# Let Your People Sing

## Lyrics

Let Your people sing.  What a glorious thing  
To hear the praises of Your children!  
As our voices soar toward Your throne, O LORD,  
Reveal to us Your holy presence.  

God, Your peace is perfect and true.  
And Your grace is making our hearts brand new.  
Through Your Word we come to know You,  
And we sing to show our love for You.  

Let Your people sing.  Let the heavens ring  
With the music of all Your sons and daughters.  
Crafting songs of praise from our hearts ablaze  
With the love of Your children for their Father.  

God, Your peace is perfect and true.  
And Your grace is making our hearts brand new.  
Through Your Word we come to know You,  
And we sing to show our love for You.  

Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  

God, Your peace is perfect and true.  
And Your grace is making our hearts brand new.  
Through Your Word we come to know You,  
And we sing to show our love for You.  

God, Your peace is perfect and true.  
And Your grace is making our hearts brand new.  
Though our words could never explain You,  
We cannot contain our love for You.  
So we sing to show our love for You.
