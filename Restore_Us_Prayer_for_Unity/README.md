# Restore Us (Prayer for Unity)

## Lyrics

When we fracture; when we fragment;  
When we fall apart.  
When forgiveness seems so distant  
From every injured heart.  

Even though breath is fleeting —  
Even though hearts may fail —  
You are our strength forever.  
Restore us.  

In the season of disagreement  
When we all fall short,  
Unify us in Christ Jesus  
To glorify our Lord.  

Even though breath is fleeting —  
Even though hearts may fail —  
You are our strength forever.  
You restore us.  
You restore us.  

It bears all things,  
Believes all things,  
And hopes all things —  
Love endures.
