# More and More

## Lyrics

O Lord, my God, in you alone I trust,  
For you have been my refuge all my days.  
And even though the Enemy will come,  
You rescue me and comfort me always.  
Who is like our God?   

As for me, I will always hope in You.  
I will lift my praise to You, more and more.   
As for me, I will shout with joy to You.  
As I sing my praise to You, more and more.   

My lips will tell Your deeds so marvelous,  
Your power and righteousness and Yours alone.  
Your mighty works I'll share with those to come,  
Though I may not know how to share them all.  

As for me, I will always hope in You.  
I will lift my praise to You, more and more.   
As for me, I will shout with joy to You.  
As I sing my praise to You, more and more.   

Though I've seen troubles, many and bitter,  
You will restore my life again.  
In all my struggles, You have delivered,  
You will restore my life again.  
Though I've seen troubles, many and bitter,  
You will restore my life again.  
In all my struggles, You have delivered,  
You will restore my life again,  
And again!  

As for me, I will always hope in You.  
I will lift my praise to You, more and more.   
As for me, I will shout with joy to You.  
As I sing my praise to You, more and more.  

Who is like our God?
